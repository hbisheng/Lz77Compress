Testing the design
=============================

- At current stage we just run the simulation in the APP/build/ folder to test the design.
- Command `bash test.sh` will help you do that.
- You can change the file name in test.sh to use different data file in CalgaryCorpus. (e.g. ./CalgaryCorpus/**bib** -> ./CalgaryCorpus/**book1**)
